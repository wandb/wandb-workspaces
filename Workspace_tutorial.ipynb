You can define a workspace programmatically by defining the workspace's properties, such as its name, associated entity and project, and the sections it should contain.\n",

        "* Programmatically create and customize workspaces by defining configurations, setting panel layouts, and organizing sections. Load and modify workspaces via URL, filter and group runs using expressions, and customize run appearances. Easily copy views across workspaces for integration.\n",
