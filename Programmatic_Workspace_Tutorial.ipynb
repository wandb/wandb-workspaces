        "* [wandb-workspaces](https://github.com/wandb/wandb-workspaces/tree/main) is a Python library for programmatically working with Weights & Biases workspaces and Reports. You can define a workspace programmatically by defining the workspace's properties, such as its name, associated entity and project, and the sections it should contain.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Programmatically create and customize workspaces by defining configurations, setting panel layouts, and organizing sections. Load and modify workspaces via URL, filter and group runs using expressions, and customize run appearances. Easily copy views across workspaces for integration.\n",

        "### Known limitations\n",

        "### 2. Sections and Panels\n",
        "* **Sections:** Organize your workspace into multiple sections, each containing a specific set of panels. Sections can be opened or closed based on your preference.\n",
        "* **Panels:** Add various types of panels such as line plots, bar plots, and scalar charts to visualize different metrics.\n",
